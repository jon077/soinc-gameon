  Title: "2. User Controlled (UC) Sprite"
  Video: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FXOR9JPmBC4"
  Summary: "<p>We have an interactive discussion about how to reformulate a real and subtly complicated business problem as a formal machine learning problem.  The real goal isn't so much to solve the problem, as to convey the point that properly mapping your business problem to a machine learning problem is both extremely important and often quite challenging.  This course doesn't dwell on how to do this mapping, though see Provost and Fawcett's book in the references.</p>"
